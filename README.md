# Building-CNN-in-Tf-2.0-with-Eager-Execution
This repository hold the building block to create CNN with only lower level Tensorflow 2.0 and Eager Execution (No Keras)
The network uses two blocks of ConvPool Layers followed by two FNN blocks (the number of blocks can be increased as desired).
This CNN was tested on mnist dataset achieving testing Accuracy of  0.9765625.
